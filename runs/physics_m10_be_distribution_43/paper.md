**Date:** 2026-02-03 16:31:32
**Mode:** physics
**Task:** m10_be_distribution

## Abstract
This report documents the automated discovery of the target system's mechanism.

## 1. Methodology (Physics)
### 1.1 Data Collection
We collected 300 samples. The dataset was split into training and holdout sets.

### 1.2 Symbolic Regression
We employed PySR to discover candidate equations.

## 2. Results
### 2.1 Discovered Equation
$$
-sin(0.16990422*log(omega)/temperature**0.028601112) - 0.46657768
$$

**Complexity:** 11
**Fit Score:** 0.9646352655632017

### 2.2 Performance Metrics
- **R^2 Score:** 0.8912
- **MSE:** 1.41e-03
- **RMSLE:** 0.026947
- **Symbolic Accuracy:** NO (Structural Variation)

## 3. Knowledge Graph Analysis
The structure was parsed into a Knowledge Graph.
- **Nodes:** 14
- **Edges:** 15

(See `kg.json` for full structure)

## 4. Conclusion
The automated system successfully recovered a candidate mechanism.
