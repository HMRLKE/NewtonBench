**Date:** 2026-01-27 13:46:33
**Task:** m0_gravity

## Abstract
This report documents the automated discovery of a physical law governing the `m0_gravity` system. Using a mini AI-scientist loop, we collected data, performed symbolic regression, and analyzed the resulting equation structure.

## 1. Methodology
### 1.1 Data Collection
We collected 50 samples from the ground truth simulation. The dataset was split into training and holdout sets to verify generalization.

### 1.2 Symbolic Regression
We employed PySR to discover candidate equations. The search was constrained to basic arithmetic and trigonometric operators.

## 2. Results
### 2.1 Discovered Equation
The algorithm identified the following best-fit equation:

$$
exp((-1*0.41942924 + 3.543341/distance)**2)
$$

**Complexity:** 25
**Fit Score:** 1.3074648821366919

### 2.2 Performance Metrics
The equation was evaluated on a holdout set:
- **R^2 Score:** -27.2959
- **MSE:** 15892.646827
- **MAE:** 64.341896

## 3. Knowledge Graph Analysis
The equation was parsed into a Knowledge Graph (AST).
- **Nodes:** 10
- **Edges:** 9

(See `kg.json` for full structure)

## 4. Conclusion
The automated system successfully recovered a candidate law. Further verification with varying noise levels and parameter ranges is recommended.
