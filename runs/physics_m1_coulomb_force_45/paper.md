**Date:** 2026-02-03 16:39:37
**Mode:** physics
**Task:** m1_coulomb_force

## Abstract
This report documents the automated discovery of the target system's mechanism.

## 1. Methodology (Physics)
### 1.1 Data Collection
We collected 300 samples. The dataset was split into training and holdout sets.

### 1.2 Symbolic Regression
We employed PySR to discover candidate equations.

## 2. Results
### 2.1 Discovered Equation
$$
q2**2.9999962*(q1**2/distance**2)*(q1 + q1)
$$

**Complexity:** 10
**Fit Score:** 11.0888855279386

### 2.2 Performance Metrics
- **R^2 Score:** 1.0000
- **MSE:** 6.62e-01
- **RMSLE:** 0.000007
- **Symbolic Accuracy:** NO (Structural Variation)

## 3. Knowledge Graph Analysis
The structure was parsed into a Knowledge Graph.
- **Nodes:** 12
- **Edges:** 13

(See `kg.json` for full structure)

## 4. Conclusion
The automated system successfully recovered a candidate mechanism.
