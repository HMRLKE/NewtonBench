**Date:** 2026-02-02 17:08:35
**Mode:** physics
**Task:** m4_snell_law

## Abstract
This report documents the automated discovery of the target system's mechanism.

## 1. Methodology (Physics)
### 1.1 Data Collection
We collected 250 samples. The dataset was split into training and holdout sets.

### 1.2 Symbolic Regression
We employed PySR to discover candidate equations.

## 2. Results
### 2.1 Discovered Equation
$$
-1*0.6072488 + 6.1494923/(-1*(-0.06798192) + 6.873504/(incidence_angle*(refractive_index_1*1.3598636/refractive_index_2)**1.1980083))
$$

**Complexity:** 3
**Fit Score:** 1.3928641910297497

### 2.2 Performance Metrics
- **R^2 Score:** 0.9991
- **MSE:** 0.075203

## 3. Knowledge Graph Analysis
The structure was parsed into a Knowledge Graph.
- **Nodes:** 18
- **Edges:** 19

(See `kg.json` for full structure)

## 4. Conclusion
The automated system successfully recovered a candidate mechanism.
