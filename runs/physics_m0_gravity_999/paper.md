# Automated Scientific Discovery Report
**Date:** 2026-02-02 14:39:39
**Mode:** physics
**Task:** m0_gravity

## Abstract
This report documents the automated discovery of the target system's mechanism.

## 1. Methodology (Physics)
### 1.1 Data Collection
We collected 50 samples. The dataset was split into training and holdout sets.

### 1.2 Symbolic Regression
We employed PySR to discover candidate equations.

## 2. Results
### 2.1 Discovered Equation
$$
(-distance + mass1)*(0.0014261389*mass2*(-distance + mass2 + 713.4688) - 0.0014261389*log(mass2))/distance
$$

**Complexity:** 18
**Fit Score:** 0.5104428550938975

### 2.2 Performance Metrics
- **R^2 Score:** 0.8227
- **MSE:** 14538579.197943

## 3. Knowledge Graph Analysis
The structure was parsed into a Knowledge Graph.
- **Nodes:** 23
- **Edges:** 22

(See `kg.json` for full structure)

## 4. Conclusion
The automated system successfully recovered a candidate mechanism.
