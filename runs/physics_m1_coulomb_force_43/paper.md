# Automated Scientific Discovery Report
**Date:** 2026-02-02 16:08:19
**Mode:** physics
**Task:** m1_coulomb_force

## Abstract
This report documents the automated discovery of the target system's mechanism.

## 1. Methodology (Physics)
### 1.1 Data Collection
We collected 100 samples. The dataset was split into training and holdout sets.

### 1.2 Symbolic Regression
We employed PySR to discover candidate equations.

## 2. Results
### 2.1 Discovered Equation
$$
-distance + distance + (q1 + q1)/(distance*((distance/(q2*(distance**(-1.0))))))
$$

**Complexity:** 17
**Fit Score:** 9.019060132339844

### 2.2 Performance Metrics
- **R^2 Score:** 1.0000
- **MSE:** 0.000000

## 3. Knowledge Graph Analysis
The structure was parsed into a Knowledge Graph.
- **Nodes:** 7
- **Edges:** 6

(See `kg.json` for full structure)

## 4. Conclusion
The automated system successfully recovered a candidate mechanism.
