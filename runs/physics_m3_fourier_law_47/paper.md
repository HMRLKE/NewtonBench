$$
sqrt(A)*delta_T*k/d
$$

**Complexity:** 8
**Fit Score:** 29.961245003418448

### 2.2 Performance Metrics
- **R^2 Score:** 1.0000
- **MSE:** 2.65e-30
- **RMSLE:** 0.000000
- **Symbolic Accuracy:** YES (Matched Ground Truth)

## 3. Knowledge Graph Analysis
The structure was parsed into a Knowledge Graph.
- **Nodes:** 9
- **Edges:** 8

(See `kg.json` for full structure)

## 4. Conclusion
The automated system successfully recovered a candidate mechanism.
